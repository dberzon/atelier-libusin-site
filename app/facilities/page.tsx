      <h2>The space</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Main studio:</strong> light-filled atelier with high ceiling, large windows and a projection-friendly wall—ideal for painting, print, projection and small showings.</li>
        <li><strong>Residency accommodations:</strong> simple, self-contained rooms; shared kitchen and communal table for crits/meals. Capacity varies by season; families by prior arrangement.</li>
        <li><strong>Outdoor extensions:</strong> garden/orchard and pavilion for installations, workshops and evening projections.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Technical resources</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Projectors & Tagtool/live drawing set-up.</li>
        <li>Basic sound equipment; small library of art books.</li>
        <li>Documentation (photo/video) on request.</li>
        <li>Close to Prague galleries and suppliers for specialist needs.</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="opacity-80">We encourage low-impact, eco-conscious approaches and often share seasonal produce from the orchard.</p>
